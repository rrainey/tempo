# Tempo-BT - A Skydiving Data Logger

A Zephyr RTOS-based flight data logging system for the nRF5340 platform, designed for capturing high-frequency sensor data during skydiving and other aerial activities. The system logs IMU, barometric, GPS, and optional magnetometer data to SD card or internal flash storage, with Bluetooth LE connectivity for wireless data transfer and configuration.

### Runtime Configuration

Many settings can be changed at runtime via mcumgr:
- Logging thresholds
- Sensor sample rates
- Auto-arm parameters

## Usage Examples

### Connecting via Bluetooth

We use [`mcumgr`](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr) for testing the Bluetooth interfaces.  This software runs on Mac and Linux systems.  We can also use the nRF Connect mobile apps for some forms of tests.

1. **Find the device**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0 conn find
```

2. **Test connection**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' echo hello
```

### File Operations

1. **List logged sessions**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' fs ls /logs
```

2. **Download a log file**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' fs download /logs/20250117/12345678/flight.txt flight.txt
```

3. **Delete a log file**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' fs delete /logs/20250117/12345678/flight.txt
```

Within this example path, `20250117` corresponds to the calendar date of the jump (`YYYMMDD`). `12345678` is a pseudo-random number assigned to each jump in that directory. The actual flight log will always be named `flight.txt`.

### Device Control

1. **Get device status**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' stat list
```

2. **Get storage information**:
```bash
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' custom storage_info -g 64
```

### Non-volatile Device Configuration Control

The device maintains several persistent settings that can be queried and modified over Bluetooth using mcumgr's config commands.

#### Available Settings

| Setting | Description | Type | Default |
|---------|-------------|------|---------|
| `app/ble_name` | Bluetooth device name | String (max 31 chars) | "TempoBT" |
| `app/user_uuid` | User identifier UUID | UUID (128-bit) | Auto-generated on first boot |
| `app/device_uuid` | Device identifier UUID | UUID (128-bit) | Auto-generated on first boot |
| `app/log_backend` | Storage backend type | String | "littlefs" |
| `app/pps_enabled` | PPS time sync enabled | Boolean | false (V1 hardware) |

#### Reading Settings

To read a specific setting:
```bash
# Read device name
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/ble_name

# Read user UUID
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/user_uuid

# Read device UUID
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/device_uuid

# Read storage backend
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/log_backend
```

#### Writing Settings

To modify a setting:
```bash
# Change device name
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/ble_name set "MyTempo"

# Set storage backend (choose "littlefs" or "fatfs")
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/log_backend set "fatfs"

# Note: UUIDs are typically not changed after initial generation, but can be set if needed
# Format: UUID must be provided as a 32-character hex string (no dashes)
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app/user_uuid set "550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000"
```

#### Viewing All Settings

To see all current settings at once:
```bash
# List all settings under the "app" namespace
mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring peer_name='Tempo-BT' config app
```

#### Notes on UUIDs

- Both `user_uuid` and `device_uuid` are automatically generated on first boot
- UUIDs are version 4 (random) format
- The `user_uuid` is intended to identify the person using the device
- The `device_uuid` uniquely identifies this specific hardware unit
- UUIDs are displayed in standard format (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)
- When setting UUIDs via mcumgr, provide them as 32 hex characters without dashes

#### Persistence

All settings are stored in non-volatile memory and persist across power cycles and firmware updates.


This revised section provides comprehensive documentation for all available settings, including examples of how to read and write each one using mcumgr commands.

### Manual Control

The device can also be controlled via the onboard button:
- **Short press**: Start/stop logging (when armed)
- **Long press (3s)**: Arm/disarm the logger

## Data Format

Log files are in extended NMEA sentence format with NMEA-style checksums. Key sentence types:

- `$PVER`: Version and metadata
- `$PIMU`: IMU data (40 Hz)
- `$PIM2`: Quaternion orientation
- `$PENV`: Environmental data (pressure, temperature)
- `$PFIX`: GPS fix information
- `$PST`: State changes
- `$PMAG`: Magnetometer data (optional)
- `$GNGGL` : Fix, from u-blox receiver
- `$GNVTG` : track made good, from u-blox receiver
- `$GNGGA` : Fix, from u-blox receiver

Example log excerpt:
```
$PVER,1.0,V1,0.1.0,2025-01-15*AB
$PSFC,880*1C
$PST,1000,IDLE,ARMED,USER*5D
$PIMU,1001,9.81,0.02,-0.15,0.001,0.002,0.003*2F
$PIM2,1001,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000*A1
```

## LED Status Indicators

The RGB LED provides visual system status:

| Color | Pattern | State |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Blue | Slow pulse | IDLE - Ready |
| Green | Slow pulse | ARMED - Waiting for trigger |
| Red | Fast flash | LOGGING - Recording data |
| Yellow | Solid | File transfer active |
| Magenta | Slow flash | Error state |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Device not visible over Bluetooth**
   - Ensure the device is powered on
   - Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your computer
   - Try resetting the device

2. **SD card not detected**
   - Verify card is properly inserted
   - Ensure card is formatted as exFAT
   - Check for supported card size (max 32GB recommended)

3. **mcumgr connection fails**
   - Update mcumgr to latest version
   - Check Bluetooth adapter compatibility
   - Try shorter connection intervals
